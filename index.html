        I am a 20 year old student in the Carolina Coding Bootcamp, looking forward
            to becoming a software developer. I am currently working with html and CSS 
            and have past experience with javascript. While in school I played sports
            which gave me tons of experience of working with a team and communicating
            thoroughly. In me free time I enjoy trying different activities and 
            hobbies and just adding a little more challenge to my life.
